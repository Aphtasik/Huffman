HUFFMAN CODING AND DECODING ALGORITHM
 
This Work has been done thanks to the help of EPITA, an engineering school specialised in computer science.

WARNING : The functions presented in the .py file may not be all fully optimised ! It may not be the most efficient way to compress and decompress file.
WARNING : This method does not work with the compression of a string composed with only one type of char (ex: "AAAAAAAAAAA"). There must be at least two different char.

I - Description

The Huffman algorithm is used to compress files. It has a compression ratio in-between 40 and 60 percent. 

Traditionally, a character of a text file is encoded on 8 bits independently of the character’s appearance frequency in the file.
The Huffman algorithm changes the characters’ encoding to take into account appearance frequency: it encodes the most frequent characters on 1 or 2 bits.
The less frequent ones will be encoded on an increasingly bigger number of bits. A file containing the text AAAAAA will now have a size of 6 bits instead of 6x8 = 48 bits (A shall be encoded on 1 bit).


II - Steps

Steps to compress the text file:
1) Build a frequency table of each character occurrence
2) Build the Huffman Tree
3) Text encoding
4) Tree encoding
5) Binarization

Decompression is done thanks to opposite functions:
- Decode Text
- Decode Tree
- Binary to character
